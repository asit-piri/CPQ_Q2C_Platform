# Problem Statement

We may all agree that clients prefer technology delivered as a Service, but they also expect flexibility. In order to attract and retain customers, stand out from the competition, and increase revenue, businesses today have a fantastic opportunity to embrace digital transformation. In order to achieve this goal, businesses need the capacity to rapidly innovate, the flexibility to select the optimal combination of technologies, and an uniform cloud experience for managing all of their applications and workloads. Sadly, the market isn't being well served by the current paragigm for corporate IT. Customers have to put up with inconsistent service across on-premises data centres and external cloud providers, as well as rigid, costly, and proprietary stacks that limit their options.
